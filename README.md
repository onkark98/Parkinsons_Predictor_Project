# Parkinsons_Predictor_Project

The project is based on machine learning to predict the severity of Parkinson's disease, indicated with the help of patient's voice as the parameter.
So the voice is taken and refined to various attributes which are used as the data for artificial neural network. The project is backed up by various technologies like Tensorflow, Keras, Pratt, Pyentropy, Android ,ngrok and Django framework.
